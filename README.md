## Description

_A web app remake of [Console API Call](https://github.com/igl-myrick/ConsoleApiCall) that displays the current top stories from the New York Times._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _You will need [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/) in order to run the program._

_1: Clone the repository to a folder of choice on your machine (by either using the "Code" button on the GitHub page, or in a terminal application using `git clone https://github.com/igl-myrick/MvcApiCall`)._

_2: Using a terminal application such as Git Bash or Windows Command Prompt, navigate to the `MvcApiCall` folder._

_3. You will need to register an API key on the [New York Times' website](https://developer.nytimes.com/)._

_4: Once you have an API key, create an `appsettings.json` file within the `MvcApiCall` folder, including the following code:_

```
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "NYT": "[YOUR-API-KEY-HERE]"
}
```

_Insert your own API key in place of [YOUR-API-KEY-HERE]._

_5: Next, run `dotnet build` in the command line to build the program._

_6: Once the program is built, run `dotnet run` to run the program, and navigate to `https://localhost:5001` in your web browser to view current stories._

## Known Bugs

* _None at the moment_
